# The authentication blueprint will have views to register new users and to log in and log out.

# A view function is the code you write to respond to requests to your application.
# Flask uses patterns to match the incoming request URL to the view that should handle it.
# The view returns data that Flask turns into an outgoing response. Flask can also go
# the other direction and generate a URL to a view based on its name and arguments.
#
# A Blueprint is a way to organize a group of related views and other code.
# Rather than registering views and other code directly with an application,
# they are registered with a blueprint. Then the blueprint is registered with
# the application when it is available in the factory function.
#
# Flaskr will have two blueprints, one for authentication functions and
# one for the blog posts functions. The code for each blueprint will go in a separate module.
# Since the blog needs to know about authentication, youâ€™ll write the authentication one first.
